# Output repository for Example Simulation with CADET
This repository stores the simulation results for RDM-Example. `CADET-RDM` automatically tracks all simulations that are started by running `main.py` from the corresponding project repository.

Each simulation run creates a dedicated branch in this output repository. The results are saved within the `src` folder of the respective branch. Additionally, a `log.tsv` file in the main branch records metadata for all runs, uniquely linking each output branch to its originating run in the project repository.
